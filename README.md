# getGas - Decentralized Gas Funding Protocol

## Overview
getGas is a **decentralized application (dApp)** that enables users to seamlessly acquire small amounts of gas for blockchain transactions. It provides a **trustless, on-chain mechanism** to request and receive gas, ensuring accessibility without financial barriers. The platform supports **microtransactions ($0.1 - $1)** on Ethereum Layer 2 networks, promoting broader Web3 adoption.

## How It Works
getGas leverages **smart contracts, a gas vault, and a relayer network** to facilitate gas transactions. The process follows these steps:

1. **User Requests Gas**
   - The user submits a request on the getGas dApp.
   - The request is recorded on-chain via the **Gas Request Smart Contract (GRSC)**.
   - Metadata includes wallet address, chain ID, requested amount, and expiration time.

2. **Gas Funding Mechanisms**
   - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Funding**: Friends, DAOs, or community members can contribute directly.
   - **Pre-Funded Gas Vault**: A decentralized contract holds funds to automatically fulfill requests.
   - **Meta-Transaction Relayer (Optional)**: Enables gas-free transactions for users via a relayer contract.

3. **Gas Distribution & Execution**
   - Once a gas request is funded, the **Gas Vault Contract** transfers gas to the requester's wallet.
   - If a relayer is used, it executes the transaction on behalf of the user.
   - The request is marked as **fulfilled** on-chain, preventing duplicate claims.

## Smart Contract Architecture
getGas will consists of **two primary smart contracts** deployed on an **EVM-compatible blockchain**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Gas Request Smart Contract (GRSC)
Handles gas requests, tracks pending requests, and manages approvals.

#### **Functions:**
```solidity
function requestGas(uint256 amount, uint256 chainId, uint256 deadline) external;
function fundGas(address requester) external payable;
function withdrawGas() external;
```
---
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Gas Vault Contract
Holds pooled funds from donors, DAOs, and community supporters. It automatically allocates gas upon request fulfillment.

#### **Functions:**
```solidity
function depositFunds() external payable;
function allocateGas(address requester, uint256 amount) internal;
function withdrawExcessFunds() external onlyOwner;
```
---


#### **Functions:**
```solidity
function executeMetaTx(address sender, bytes memory txData) external;
function verifySignature(address sender, bytes memory signature) internal view returns (bool);
```

## Transaction Flow
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ User Requests Gas**
- User submits a request through the getGas dApp.
- The request is recorded in the **Gas Request Smart Contract (GRSC)**.
- A blockchain event is emitted for funders.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Gas Funding Options**
‚úÖ **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Funding**: Direct contributions from friends or DAOs.
‚úÖ **Auto-Funding via Gas Vault**: If pre-funded, gas is disbursed automatically.
‚úÖ **Relayer Execution**: Enables transactions without upfront gas fees.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Gas Distribution**
- The **Gas Vault Contract** transfers gas to the requester‚Äôs wallet.
- The request status is updated as **fulfilled**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Anti-Sybil Measures**
- **Rate Limits:** Users can request gas only X times per day/week.
- **Social Verification:** POAPs, ENS, or Gitcoin Passport validation.
- **Stake-Based System (Future Feature):** Users stake tokens to prevent spam.

## Frontend & UI Implementation
The getGas front-end will be built using:
- **React.js / Next.js** for the web application.
- **Ethers.js / Wagmi** for blockchain interactions.
- **Smart Contract SDK** for seamless integration.

### **UI Features**
- **Request Dashboard**: Displays open gas requests.
- **One-Click Funding**: Allows MetaMask and WalletConnect funding.
- **Gas Vault Status**: Shows available funds for auto-fulfillment.

---

## Supported Blockchains & Deployment
getGas will initially launch on **Ethereum Layer 2 networks** to minimize transaction fees:
‚úÖ **Arbitrum**  
‚úÖ **Optimism**  
‚úÖ **Base**  
‚úÖ **zkSync**  
(More chains will be integrated as demand grows.)

---

## Conclusion
getGas **removes onboarding friction** for new Web3 users by providing an efficient, decentralized method to obtain gas. By leveraging **smart contract-based funding, P2P gas requests, and relayer support**, it ensures **trustless and seamless gas acquisition** for Web3 accessibility and adoption.

## Future Enhancements
üîπ **DAO Governance**: Allow communities to manage the Gas Vault treasury.  
üîπ **Gas Subscription Model**: Users can auto-refill their gas balances.  
üîπ **Multi-Chain Expansion**: Support for Solana, Polygon, and other L1/L2s.
